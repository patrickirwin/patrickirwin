I'm a Professor of Planetary Physics at the University of Oxford, working on remote sensing of planetary atmospheres. I have been a co-investigator on a number of spacecraft missions, such as Cassini/CIRS, Venus Express/VIRTIS and Rosetta/VIRTIS and I'm also involved with ground-based observations of the giant planets with telescopes such as IRTF, Gemini, UKIRT and VLT. My main research interests at present are the study of the gas giants, especially the ice giants (Uranus and Neptune) and also exoplanets.

This GitHub project contains various repositories to make the data I have used in various papers available to interested researchers.
